                <h2> Abstract</h2>
                <p> Providing a user-friendly interface for the operators of 
                robotic devices is challenging but can save them precious time when
                  reprogramming a device to perform different tasks under varying conditions. 
                  This paper presents a novel pipeline that adds context awareness at every 
                  step of the task execution and employs LLMs to develop a textual interface 
                  that supports commands and directions in natural language. Contextual 
                  awareness is achieved by analysing input from a camera that supervises 
                  the task execution and leveraging 6D pose estimation and scene graph 
                  generation models, to create an enriched representation of the task's 
                  environment. The rich scene graph incorporates spatial information and 
                  refined relationships between objects, and along with the user prompt in 
                  natural language is given as input to an LLM-powered chatbot, thus 
                  enabling a more intuitive interaction between the user and the robot that 
                  requires the minimum information from the user. The first experiments in a 
                  simulated environment demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach 
                  in facilitating task execution through natural language inputs, empowering 
                  users without programming expertise to interact seamlessly with robotic systems and achieve 
                complicated tasks with minimum effort.</p>

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>To place the yellow cube on pad three, the blue cube and green cube, which are on top of the yellow cube, must be moved first to avoid violating the rule of not moving objects under other objects. The blue cube is moved to pad two, followed by the green cube to the same location, ensuring that objects are not stacked on the table surface and that no two objects occupy the same space. After clearing the yellow cube, it is grasped and placed on pad three.

<h2> Abstract Prompts</h2>
<h3> Scenario 1</h3>
<strong>Prompt:<strong> 
> <blockquote> Clean up the table   </blockquote>

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>The task was to clean up the table by moving all cubes off the table surface and onto the pads. The sequence started by moving the yellow_cube, which was directly on the table surface, followed by the green_cube, which was on pad_one. The yellow_cube was then placed on pad_one, where the green_cube originally was. Next, the blue_cube, which was on pad_two, was moved, followed by the red_cube, also on pad_two. The green_cube was placed on the table surface temporarily to make room. Finally, the blue_cube was placed on pad_one (on top of the yellow_cube), and the red_cube was placed on pad_two. This sequence ensured that all cubes were moved off the table surface and onto the pads, adhering to the rules and minimizing movements.</p>

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>To put at least one cube on each pad, the task starts with the yellow_cube, which is initially on the table_surface and not on any pad. The yellow_cube is grasped and placed on pad_three, which initially has no cube on it. This action ensures that each pad (pad_one, pad_two, and pad_three) has at least one cube on it. The blue_cube is already on pad_two, and the green_cube is on pad_one. The task is completed with minimal movements, adhering to the rules and the prompt's requirements.</p>

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>To make two stacks of two cubes on pad three and pad two, the task starts by moving the yellow_cube to pad_three. Then, the green_cube is placed on top of the yellow_cube to form the first stack on pad_three. Next, the red_cube is moved to pad_two, and finally, the blue_cube is placed on top of the red_cube to form the second stack on pad_two.

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>The task is to place the ingredients of a burger (red_cube as patty and green_cube as lettuce) on the plates (pads). First, the red_cube (patty) is grasped and placed on pad_three, representing one plate. Then, the green_cube (lettuce) is grasped and placed on pad_two, representing another plate. The task is completed by returning the arm to the home position, ensuring all movements contribute meaningfully to arranging the burger ingredients on the plates as requested.</p>

<strong>LLM Explanation:</strong> 
> <p>To make the tallest tower possible, the strategy is to stack the cubes on top of each other in descending order of their initial positions from right to left, as they are all on the table surface and no cube is initially on top of another. The sequence starts with grasping the yellow_cube, placing it on the green_cube, then grasping the blue_cube and placing it on the yellow_cube, followed by grasping the red_cube and placing it on the blue_cube, and finally grasping the yellow_cube_2 and placing it on the red_cube. This sequence ensures the tallest possible tower is built with the available cubes, adhering to the rules of not moving pads or the table, and ensuring no unnecessary movements are made.</p>
