The blue cube is moved to pad two, followed by the green cube to the same location, ensuring that objects are not stacked on the table surface and that no two objects occupy the same space. After clearing the yellow cube, it is grasped and placed on pad three. Each grasp and place action is followed by returning the arm to the home position to ensure the arm is correctly positioned for the next action.", "prompt": "Place the yellow cube on pad three "}
