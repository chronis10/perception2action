Following this, the red cube is moved from pad two and placed on top of the blue cube. Next, the green cube, which was initially under the blue cube, is moved and placed on top of the red cube. Finally, the yellow cube, initially on pad one, is moved and placed on top of the green cube. Each 'grasp' and 'place' action is followed by a 'go_home' command to reset the arm's position, ensuring the task is completed efficiently and according to the rules.", "prompt": "At start place the blue cube on the pad three, then place the red cube on top of the blue cube, then place the green cube on top of the red cube and finally place the yellow cube on top of the green cube."}
