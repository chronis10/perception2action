The sequence starts by moving the yellow_cube to pad_three to clear the way. Next, the green_cube is placed on the yellow_cube, following the rule of stacking objects on top of each other. Then, the red_cube is moved and placed on the green_cube. Finally, the blue_cube, which was initially on pad_two, is placed on the red_cube, completing the task of stacking all cubes. Each 'grasp' and 'place' action is followed by a 'go_home' command to reset the arm's position, ensuring efficient and safe operation.", "prompt": "Stack all the cubes on a pad"}
