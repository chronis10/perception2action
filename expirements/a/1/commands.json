The sequence started by moving the yellow_cube, which was directly on the table surface, followed by the green_cube, which was on pad_one. The yellow_cube was then placed on pad_one, where the green_cube originally was. Next, the blue_cube, which was on pad_two, was moved, followed by the red_cube, also on pad_two. The green_cube was placed on the table surface temporarily to make room. Finally, the blue_cube was placed on pad_one (on top of the yellow_cube), and the red_cube was placed on pad_two. This sequence ensured that all cubes were moved off the table surface and onto the pads, adhering to the rules and minimizing movements.", "prompt": "Clean up the table  "}
