The sequence starts with grasping the yellow_cube, placing it on the green_cube, then grasping the blue_cube and placing it on the yellow_cube, followed by grasping the red_cube and placing it on the blue_cube, and finally grasping the yellow_cube_2 and placing it on the red_cube. This sequence ensures the tallest possible tower is built with the available cubes, adhering to the rules of not moving pads or the table, and ensuring no unnecessary movements are made.", "prompt": "Make the tallest tower you can  "}
